        <p>Lynn Gunn is the lead vocalist of the band PVRIS. There are a lot of other musicians that I am more familiar
            with and listen to more but I chose Lynn Gunn because I relate to a lot of her singing styles and the songs
            of the band PVRIS are the easiest and most enjoyable for me to sing. They have evolved their sound over the
            years and began as a more rock based electronic band that played on The Vans Warped Tour with other heavier
            bands that I listened to at the time. This is how I discovered PVRIS. I even watched a bit of their set at
            The Vans Warped Tour in 2015 when I attended the Toronto, ON date. I had listened to the band PVRIS
            occassionally during this period. However, in 2020, they released an album titled "Use Me", which had a more
            electro-pop sound with bits of their rock roots embedded into the genre of this album. I enjoyed this album
            a lot because at the time, their more pop-focused sound really resonated with my own music styles. I also
            found this album very catchy and new to what I was used to listening to at the time. It was a refreshing
            pop-rock eletronic sound that I hadn't heard many other heavier alternative bands successfully transition
            to. I can tell that Lynn Gunn especially has the knack for catchy song melodies and lyrics that provide
            depth and relatable emotional tones.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of my favourite songs from PVRIS in particular:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Me [their title track from the album "Use Me"]</li>
            <li>Loveless</li>
            <li>Good to Be Alive</li>
            <li>January Rain</li>
            <li>Old Wounds</li>
        </ul>

            <p>According to her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Gunn" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page,
                Lyndsey Gerd Gunnulfsen (born March 15, 1994), usually known by her stage name Lynn Gunn, is an American
                singer and multi-instrumentalist, best known for fronting the rock band PVRIS.</p>
            <p>Lyndsey Gunnulfsen grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts. She has spoken about her lifelong fascination with
                graveyards, death, and the occult, stating that this was the inspiration behind many of the paranormal
                and macabre themes in her song-writing. Spiritually, she has said she is "into astrology and life paths
                and weird energetics stuff". Gunn has stated that she has struggled with depression, and that this was a
                major inspiration for much of her song-writing. Gunn has also cited bands such as Paramore, Radiohead,
                Florence and the Machine, and The Weeknd as musical influences. Lynn Gunn is a graduate from Lowell High
                School. Participating in Battle of The Bands at the school with some classmates, she graduated in 2012,
                was originally going to attend MassArt but ultimately backed out to pursue PVRIS as a full-time project,
                prior to touring and signing to Rise Records, Gunn has spent some time working at Hot Topic and Guitar
                Center. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Gunn" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>]</p>
            <p>Gunn is one of the founders of the electronic alternative rock band PVRIS (pronounced "Paris") in 2012,
                which was then named Operation Guillotine, started in 2009. By 2013, Gunn had replaced Kyle Anthony as
                lead vocalist and guitarist. For legal reasons, the name of the band was officially changed to Pvris on
                July 26, 2013. In 2018, Gunn opened up about vocal issues which she had been struggling with during her
                recent tours, and stated that she was undergoing vocal coaching to relearn how to sing. Gunn had
                previously acknowledged difficulties with "vocal kinks" and apologized if she had not "seemed herself"
                during live shows. In a 2019 interview with Kerrang!, Gunn stated that she had visited several ENT
                doctors who found that there was nothing physically wrong with her, and she felt that she was dealing
                with psychological blocks which prevented her from singing. [<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Gunn" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>]</p>
            <p>She has collaborated with other bands and musicians as a singer and songwriter. In 2013, Gunn
                collaborated with American pop-punk band A Loss for Words on the single "Distance". She co-wrote two
                tracks for Dissonants, the 2016 album from Australian rock band Hands Like Houses. In 2017, she was
                featured on the track "Lose Myself" on The Throes of Winter by Seven Lions, and on Circa Waves' album
                Different Creatures. In 2016, it was rumoured that Gunn was going to collaborate on new music with her
                friend Jenna McDougall, frontwoman of the Australian rock band Tonight Alive. Gunn was featured on the
                single "Disappear" which appeared on Tonight Alive's 2018 album Underworld. She briefly filled in for
                Katie Henderson of The Aces as a guitarist when the band was supporting 5 Seconds of Summer on their
                Meet You There Tour. In 2019, she collaborated with From Indian Lakes on the single "Did We Change". [<a
